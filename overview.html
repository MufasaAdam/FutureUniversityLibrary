                    teaching and research achievement. Background The library inception was in 1990 as an
                    integral
                    and central
                    component of the University. Being an academic library, its services are geared towards its
                    immediate users, namely

                    The library started automation in 2007 by using a Library Information System (LIS) known as
                    WINISIS which is a UNESCO
                    product. WINISIS is an arabized and integrated system that accommodates all library operations.
                    However, in 2010 the
                    LIS is converted into a new more developed open- source system . This is an in-house system
                    developed by the University's Center for E-Learning & Software Development (CESD).
